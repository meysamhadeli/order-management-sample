## The Goals of This Project

- :sparkle: Using `Vertical Slice Architecture` for architecture level.
- :sparkle: Using `Domain Driven Design (DDD)` to implement all business processes in modules.
- :sparkle: Using `CQRS` implementation with `MediatR` library.
- :sparkle: Using `Postgres` for database level in our modules.
- :sparkle: Using `AspNetCore OpenApi` for `generating` built-in support `OpenAPI documentation` in ASP.NET Core.
- :sparkle: Using `Minimal API` for all endpoints.
- :sparkle: Using `Unit Testing` for testing our funnctionlity.
- :sparkle: Using `Fluent Validation` and a `Validation Pipeline Behaviour` on top of `MediatR`.
- :sparkle: Using `IdentityServer` for implementation authentication and authorization base on `OpenID-Connect` and `OAuth2`.

## Structure of Project

In this project I used a mix of [clean architecture](https://jasontaylor.dev/clean-architecture-getting-started/), [vertical slice architecture](https://jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/) and I used [feature folder structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders/) to structure my files.

We have a separate module ([IdentityServer](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer)) for authentication and authorization of each request. Once signed-in users are issued a JWT token. This token is used by other module to validate the user, read claims and allow access to authorized/role specific endpoints.

I treat each request as a distinct use case or slice, encapsulating and grouping all concerns from front-end to back.
When adding or changing a feature in an application in n-tire architecture, we are typically touching many "layers" in an application. We are changing the user interface, adding fields to models, modifying validation, and so on. Instead of coupling across a layer, we couple vertically along a slice. We `minimize coupling` `between slices`, and `maximize coupling` `in a slice`.

With this approach, each of our vertical slices can decide for itself how to best fulfill the request. New features only add code, we're not changing shared code and worrying about side effects.

Instead of grouping related action methods in one controller, as found in traditional ASP.net controllers, I used the [REPR pattern](https://deviq.com/design-patterns/repr-design-pattern). Each action gets its own small endpoint, consisting of a route, the action, and an `IMediator` instance (see [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)). The request is passed to the `IMediator` instance, routed through a [`Mediatr pipeline`](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2014/09/09/tackling-cross-cutting-concerns-with-a-mediator-pipeline/) where custom [middleware](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR/wiki/Behaviors) can log, validate and intercept requests. The request is then handled by a request specific `IRequestHandler` which performs business logic before returning the result.

The use of the [mediator pattern](https://dotnetcoretutorials.com/2019/04/30/the-mediator-pattern-in-net-core-part-1-whats-a-mediator/) in my controllers creates clean and [thin controllers](https://codeopinion.com/thin-controllers-cqrs-mediatr/). By separating action logic into individual handlers we support the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) and [Don't Repeat Yourself principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), this is because traditional controllers tend to become bloated with large action methods and several injected `Services` only being used by a few methods.

I used CQRS to decompose my features into small parts that makes our application:

- Maximize performance, scalability and simplicity.
- Easy to maintain and add features to. Changes only affect one command or query, avoiding breaking changes or creating side effects.
- It gives us better separation of concerns and cross-cutting concern (with help of mediatr behavior pipelines), instead of bloated service classes doing many things.

Using the CQRS pattern, we cut each business functionality into vertical slices, for each of these slices we group classes (see [technical folders structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders)) specific to that feature together (command, handlers, infrastructure, repository, controllers, etc). In our CQRS pattern each command/query handler is a separate slice. This is where you can reduce coupling between layers. Each handler can be a separated code unit, even copy/pasted. Thanks to that, we can tune down the specific method to not follow general conventions (e.g. use custom SQL query or even different storage). In a traditional layered architecture, when we change the core generic mechanism in one layer, it can impact all methods.

## How to Run

> ### Build
To `build` project, run this command in the `root` of the project:
```bash
dotnet build
```

> ### Run
To `run` project, run this command in the root of the `Api` folder of project, where the `csproj` file is located:
```bash
dotnet run
```

> ### Test

To `test` project, run this command in the `root` of the project:
```bash
dotnet test
```

> ### Documentation Apis

This project provides `API documentation` and navigate to `/swagger` for `Swagger OpenAPI` or `/scalar/v1` for `Scalar OpenAPI` to visit list of endpoints.

As part of API testing, I created the [client.rest](./client.rest) file which can be run with the [REST Client](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient) `VSCode plugin`.
